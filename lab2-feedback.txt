This was a very good project which attracted 110 points and contributed 37.4% to your overall module grade of 77.4%. Well done!
I particularly liked the clarity and depth of your documentation, and the fact that you had completed a significant number of quite complex
and challenging modifications to the base Marvin system. The use of a voice generator was a nice touch, and I was impressed by your perseverance in face of the difficulties you faced with some elements of the hardware and firmware stack.
Good work!

Thanks for your contribution, and best of luck for the future!
